### Defect-Detection-on-Metal-Surface
# Objective
This project focus on detecting the type of metal surface defect which will help for better quality productions of Metals for the industries,building a deep learning model which detects the type of defect on metal surface produced

# Dataset Description
The dataset GC10-DET is collected from upcoming paper " Deep Metallic Surface Defect Detection: the New Benchmark and Detection Network" . The images of 10 common Metallic Surface defects were collected, and their box level ground-truth were labeled. The dataset includes 3570 gray-scale images.

Punching: In the production line of the strip, the steel strip needs to be punched according to the
product specifications; mechanical failure may lead to unwanted punching, resulting in punching defects.

Welding line: When the strip is changed, it is necessary to weld the two coils of the strip, and the
weld line is produced. Strictly speaking, this is not a defect, but it needs to be automatically detected and tracked to be circumvented in subsequent cuts.

Crescent gap: In the production of steel strip, cutting sometimes results in defects, just like half
a circle.

Water spot: A water spot is produced by drying in production. Under different products and
processes, the requirements for this defect are different. However, because the water spots are generally with low contrast, and are similar to other defects such as oil spots, they are usually detected by mistake.

Oil spot: An oil spot is usually caused by the contamination of mechanical lubricant, which will
affect the appearance of the product. Silk spot: A local or continuous wave-like plaque on a strip surface that may appear on the upper and lower surfaces, and the density is uneven in the whole strip length direction. Generally, the main reason lies in the uneven temperature of the roller and uneven pressure.

Inclusion: Inclusion is a typical defect of metal surface defects, usually showing small spots,
fish scale shape, strip shape, block irregular distribution in the strip of the upper and lower surface (global or local), and is often accompanied by rough pockmarked surfaces. Some inclusions are loose and easy to fall off and some are pressed into the plate.

Rolled pit: Rolled pits are periodic bulges or pits on the surface of a steel plate that are punctate,
flaky, or strip-like. They are distributed throughout the strip length or section, mainly caused by work roll or tension roll damage.

Crease: A crease is a vertical transverse fold, with regular or irregular spacing across the strip, or
at the edge of the strip. The main reason is the local yield along the moving direction of the strip in the uncoiling process.

Waist folding: There are obvious folds in the defect parts, a little more popular, a little like
wrinkles, indicating that the local deformation of the defect is too large. The reason is due to low-carbon.
